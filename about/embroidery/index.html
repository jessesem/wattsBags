<p>We have higher quality embroidery standards than any other bag company period.  We can setup any logo and we offer thousands of thread colors.  Once your logo is setup in our system, we will not charge extra to place it on the majority of our bags for your future bag orders. <br />
    <strong>EMBROIDERY FEATURES:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>High stitch counts which prevent your branding from unraveling even after years of use.</li>
    <li>Large logos that can be recognized from a distance.</li>
    <li>Our bags are designed to highlight your companies branding and not ours.</li>
    <li>The majority of our bags allow you to embroider in multiple locations.</li>
    <li>Since most of our bags are sewn in the United States, we are able to offer lots of embroidery sizes and placement options that other bag companies canâ€™t offer.</li>
    <li>Text embroidery is included in the price of most of our bags. </li>
    <li>We use the best embroidery equipment and software available in the market.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>We have thousands of company and school logos on file. If we do not have your logo on file, simply email us a copy of it and we will set it up.  If you have questions about our embroidery or which logos we have on file, please contact us by phone or email.>
