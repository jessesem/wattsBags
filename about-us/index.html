                    <h2>Header Two</h2>


                  <p>Our founder, Alice Avis, is a 3rd generation seamstress. In 1982, she started Watts Baggs as a way to provide for her growing family.  Alice's talents, creativity, and ability to design custom bags made her products superior to what was available in the market.  Alice had a vision of building a company that could provide not only for her family but others in the community.  She always tried to employ mothers that needed help to support their own families.  Today, Watts Baggs is still a privately owned family business that follows Alice's original vision.</p>

                <p>From the beginning, Watts Baggs has built high quality products to our customers' specifications and needs.  Our ability to build custom bags has made us unique from other bag companies.  This is why we can work with Fortune 500 companies down to small businesses, including work with international businesses, professional sports teams, and universities. Watts Baggs can be defined as having “Big Business Ability with Small Business Customer Service”.  No job is too big or small, and we can work with any deadline or budget.  </p>

                <p>Our process for making custom bags is simple.  We listen to your needs, suggestions, and requests.  We then discuss the best options to meet your requirements and use the best materials available.  The end result is a long-lasting product built around you.  We believe you should not have to compromise by using a poorly designed off-the-shelf bag.</p>

                <p>We are proud to make our bags in the U.S.A., and we would be honored to make your bag here.  Let us help you with your specific needs.</p>
