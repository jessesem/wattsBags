                    <h1>Don't just take our word for it!</h1>

                    <p>"Our sports medicine department recently ordered 6 bags from Watts and we have been very pleased with what we received. The bags were hand made for us in just two weeks, with custom embroidery on the top and front. Watts was able to accommodate every request we made quickly and affordable. The material and zippers are strong and durable and should last for years of use in our facilities. The athletic trainer II bag is the perfect size for road trips or just taking out to practice. The inside of the bag has many different options for organization using the dividers; there are also zippered pouches and elastic straps for holding small easy to grab items. The outside features full size compartments on every side for holding additional supplies. Overall we are thrilled with the product and the experience of working with Watts Bags on this order, we will be sure to order from them again in the future." <strong>Mike McNulty-Athletic Trainer (Chicago Cubs)</strong></p>

                    <p>"Over 700 of our Sales & Clinical representatives in the Field rely on the Quality & the Durability of our "Watts Bags". Most people have 2 of them, one large and 1 smaller bag that allows them to carry everything they need to handle any surgical situation!  Jonathan Watts is wonderful to work with and I feel so well taken care. He makes the ordering process easy - I simply send him a new request of 10-20 bags each month, and he has them shipped directly to each field reps home. We looked at other options in the past, and decided that we already had the best bag on the Market! I highly recommend Watts Bags - they take pride in their work and can customize bags to suit your personal or professional needs. We love them!"<strong>Tonia Davis, Program Coordinator (Medtronic USA)</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>"I moved to Utah a few years ago and therefore was able to drop into Watts Bags for a quick warranty repair on a device implant bag. I envisioned a long process to accomplish the task. Upon arrival Eric said that if I could wait he could have it done for me in less than 5 minutes. What great service! While waiting I reminisced about my first bag I purchased from Watts Baggs over 18 years ago.  I have worked for a few companies over the years and made it a top-priority to order a Watts Bag with my company logo on it as quickly as possible. The matriarch and founder of Watts Bags, Alice Avis, with humble beginnings would patiently hand type my orders one click at a time on her old typewriter; I laughed every time. Now she has passed the company on to her children to continue the legacy she began. Quality products, great service and strong values make Watts Bags what it has been and is today. Best wishes to Alice and her family." <strong>Dan Woodruff (Biotronik)</strong></p>

                    <p>"I was already a long time looking for custom made bags, but it was really difficult to find. I found Watts Bags and they were the only ones who could design and customize a bag the way we were looking for. Even at a long distance and with communication only by email, this was possible! After 10 emails of requirements and suggestions back and forth we could count with a prototype followed by 16 bags ordered as we wanted. These bags are really specific and customized to our needs and such concept wasn't available anywhere else." <strong>Ines Melo (Medtronic Portugal)</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>"At Bausch + Lomb Surgical, our business demands our representatives to constantly be going from OR to OR, hospital to hospital, and office to office. Our device representatives needed a high-quality, durable yet convenient way to carry our ophthalmic devices to and from every day requirements of the job. Watts Bags provided over 100 professional sales bags for us which our reps absolutely love. Prices were reasonable, product is great, and most importantly service was fantastic with great follow-up! When I am ready for more bags, I will be a repeat customer at Watts Bags."
                    <strong>Cody McKenzie(Bausch + Lomb)</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>"Watts Bags Inc. offers great products at competitive prices. But what separates them from other companies is the personal service. I know that when I call or email I'm not going to get a machine or get some template email response. I can reach out to Jonathan Watts and hear back from him quickly. I highly recommend him to anyone interested in purchasing bags for sports medicine or otherwise. Thanks again to everyone over at Watts Bags"
                    <strong>Ben Schuler-Trainer(Dartmouth)</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>When I found Watts Bags, I had just come out of an unpleasant experience with another vendor that included delays, communication issues, and an unacceptable end product.  From the time that I  contacted Jonathan, he listened to my needs, worked with me carefully on my design, and communicated through the process.  Years (and several additional bag designs) later, I still receive the same level of attention on the design elements and focus on communication.  The process is positive and efficient.  My bags look great, and I believe in the product enough to put my name on them and stand behind them. <strong>Vaughn Trannon-Trannon Culinary</strong></p>

                    <p>"Watts Bags has consistently provided great quality product bags for our company over the last 7 years. Our projects are always custom and Watts does a great job at paying close attention to detail and really listening to our specific needs." <strong>Clint Poulsen-Marketing Communications Manager(Merit Medical)</strong> </p>
