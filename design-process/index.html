OUR 12 STEP DESIGN PROCESS

1) You work with one of our designers to create the product that will fit your needs.

2) We create all of the patterns needed to manufacture your project.

3) We research and order all of the necessary supplies and materials.

4) Our engineer sets up your patterns in AutoCAD to optimize fabric and material usage and create perfect patterns.

5) If your bag requires embroidery, we setup and digitize your company branding including any text or logos.

6) We cut all of your different fabrics and materials.

7) We sew the prototype here in our U.S. facility.

8) We start the final assembly, which can include installation of plastics, foams, internal partitions, and wheel/telescoping handle assembly.

9) To ensure the bag meets your specifications, we undergo final quality control inspection on the prototype.

10) You examine the prototype so we can discuss any necessary changes.

11) We incorporate any changes to the prototype or, if necessary, we make a new prototype.

12) You receive a future production cost for bags to be manufactured in our U.S. facility.  If needed, we can send your prototype to our overseas facility as a manufacturing alternative.
