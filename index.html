                <p>Our founder, Alice Avis, is a 3rd generation seamstress. In 1982, she started Watts Baggs as a way to provide for her growing family. Alice's talents, creativity, and ability to design custom bags made her products superior to what was available in the market. Alice had a vision of building a company that could provide not only for her family but others in the community. She always tried to employ mothers that needed help to support their own families. Today, Watts Baggs is still a privately owned family business that follows Alice's original vision.</p>
